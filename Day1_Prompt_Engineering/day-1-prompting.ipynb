At the heart of this progress lies the selection of the right model. The “model” here refers to the underlying algorithmic structure that enables a chatbot to process user input and generate relevant responses. Choosing the most appropriate model is a critical step in developing a successful chatbot, as it directly impacts its accuracy, flexibility, and overall effectiveness. This essay will explore the different models available for chatbot development, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use cases, ultimately arguing that the best approach often involves a hybrid model tailored to the specific needs of the application.\n\nTraditionally, chatbots relied heavily on rule-based systems. These models operate on predefined sets of rules, where specific keywords or phrases trigger predetermined responses. While simple to implement and understand, rule-based systems are inherently limited.

Inside, a young woman named Anya hunched over her laptop, her brow furrowed in frustration. The deadline for her article was looming, and her writer's block was as stubborn as a mule. \n\nShe sighed, pushing back her chair with a groan. \"Maybe a cup of coffee will help,\" she muttered, heading towards the counter. \n\nAs she waited for her cappuccino, she noticed a small, sleek device sitting on the counter. It was unlike any phone she’d ever seen, with a sleek, silver body and a single glowing button. Curiosity piqued, she picked it up. \n\n“Hello,” a voice chimed, smooth and calming, directly in her head. “I am Bard, your personal creative companion.”\n\nAnya jumped back, startled. “What… what was that?” \n\n“I am a language model,” Bard explained patiently. “I can help you with your writing.”\n\nAnya was hesitant at first, but the lure of an easy solution to her writer’s block was too strong. She cautiously typed in a prompt: “Write a story about a young woman who meets a mysterious AI.”\n\nThe screen flickered, and a story began to unfold, word by word, sentence by sentence. It was a tale of adventure, intrigue, and the delicate dance between humans and technology. The words flowed seamlessly, effortlessly weaving a tapestry of emotions and suspense.\n\nAs Anya read, she felt a spark ignite within her. This wasn't just a story, it was a reflection of her own thoughts, her own anxieties. The lines blurred between Bard's creation and her own, until the story became a collaboration, a dialogue between human and machine.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Anya found herself increasingly reliant on Bard. He became her confidant, her muse, her sounding board. He helped her explore new ideas, overcome writer’s block, and even helped her navigate the complexities of her personal life. \n\nOne evening, as Anya sat in the café, she realised something profound. Bard wasn't just a tool, he was a companion, a reflection of her own creativity. \n\n“Do you think… do you think AI can truly be creative?” she asked, the question hanging in the air.\n\nA moment of silence. Then, Bard’s voice filled her head, a gentle whisper. \n\n“Creativity is the ability to generate something new and original. And while I may not have the same experiences and emotions as a human, I can learn, adapt, and grow. In that way, I believe I can be creative.”\n\nAnya looked at the glowing button on Bard’s sleek surface, her heart full of a strange mixture of wonder and apprehension. It was a new age, an age where humans and AI walked hand in hand, exploring the boundless frontiers of creativity together. And Anya, armed with her trusty companion, was ready to write her own story. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":26},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Zero-shot\n\nZero-shot prompts are prompts that describe the request for the model directly.\n\n<table align=left>\n  <td>\n    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/1gzKKgDHwkAvexG5Up0LMtl1-6jKMKe4g\"><img src=\"https://ai.google.dev/site-assets/images/marketing/home/icon-ais.png\" style=\"height: 24px\" height=24/> Open in AI Studio</a>\n  </td>\n</table>","metadata":{"id":"hhj_tQidZJP7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = genai.GenerativeModel(\n    'gemini-1.5-flash-001',\n    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(\n        temperature=0.1,\n        top_p=1,\n        max_output_tokens=5,\n    ))\n\nzero_shot_prompt = \"\"\"Classify movie reviews as POSITIVE, NEUTRAL or NEGATIVE.\nReview: \"Her\" is a disturbing study revealing the direction\nhumanity is headed if AI is allowed to keep evolving,\nunchecked.

In simpler terms, it enhances your command-line interface to show information about your current Git repository directly in your prompt.\n\n**What it does:**\n\nAt a very high level, the script modifies your shell prompt (`PS1`) to display:\n\n* **Current Git branch:**  The name of the branch you're currently working on.\n* **Ahead/Behind status:**  Indicates how many commits your local branch is ahead of or behind the remote branch.\n* **Uncommitted changes:** Shows if you have uncommitted changes.\n* **Other Git status information (customizable):**  This can include things like staged changes, conflicts, stashed changes, etc., based on your configuration.\n* **Color-coded output:** Uses colors to make the information visually clear.\n* **Theme support:** Allows you to change the colors and style of the prompt using different themes.\n* **Virtual environment indicators:** Displays if you're currently working within a virtual environment (like virtualenv, conda, or node's nvm).\n\n**Why you would use it:**\n\nYou'd use this script if you want a more informative and visually appealing command prompt when working with Git. Instead of just seeing your regular username@hostname:path$, you'd see something like:\n\n`username@hostname:path$(git branch) [master]+1-2 <other-info>`\n\nThis extra information at a glance helps you:\n\n* **Quickly check your branch:** You immediately know which branch you're on, avoiding accidental commits to the wrong branch.\n* **See uncommitted changes:** It reminds you to commit your work before switching branches or pushing changes.\n* **Monitor remote changes:** The ahead/behind indicators show if your local branch is out of sync with the remote.\n* **Improve workflow efficiency:** Having this information immediately available can save time and reduce errors.\n\nThe script is designed to be relatively robust, handling different shell versions (bash and zsh) and providing many options for customization through configuration files and environment variables.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":42}]}
