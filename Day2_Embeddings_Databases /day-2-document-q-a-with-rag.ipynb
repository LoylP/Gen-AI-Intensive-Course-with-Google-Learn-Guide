A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n\n1. Indexing\n2. Retrieval\n3. Generation\n\nIndexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.\n\nUsing [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search documents.\n\n","metadata":{"id":"CsVPnR8VbXE6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup\n\nFirst, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.","metadata":{"id":"akuOzK4dJl3j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%pip install -U -q \"google-generativeai>=0.8.3\" chromadb","metadata":{"id":"JbXe7Oodc5dP","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-17T18:23:15.256905Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-17T18:23:15.257297Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-17T18:24:07.889058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-17T18:23:15.257261Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-17T18:24:07.887474Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.
